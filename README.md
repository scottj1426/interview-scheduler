# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

*During the challenged I learned mainly that Rails is your friend. Along the way as I setup the backend Rails continued to give me the answers to my bugs as I develped the controller to the React side. I also learned that in a time crunch funtionality is priority over looks as I attempted to make a Semantic Ui React based Interface, but that didnt go as planned. 

How to run your app
To run the app Simple use Rails S for the server and use bin/webpack-dev-server for the React/webpack side. 

How you would test it

For testing I would use JEST for React spec and Rspec for Rails testing. 

Places you struggled
I struggled at getting postgres to be my friend. At the start of the challenge my database connecition was very broken and I wasnt sure why. 

Things youâ€™re proud of
I am most proud of figuring out why Rails and React were not playing together well at first. I also am proud that I was able to setup a full app front to back with minimal issues in under 2 hours and be on my way to POST requests for the second acceptance requirement for the backend.
